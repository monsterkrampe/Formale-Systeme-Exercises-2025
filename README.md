# Formale Systeme Exercises 2025

This repo contains a bit of extra material for the exercises in the Formale Systeme lecture given at the TU Dresden in Winter Semester 2025/2026.

## Notes on Setup

Using [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) / `lake`:

- Install `elan`, e.g. via `nix-shell -p elan` or simply `nix develop` if you are using nix.
- Run `lake build` to build the project. If the build is successful, the proofs are correct :tada:
